/**
* Computes the tangent of a number on \\( \[-\pi/4, \pi/4] \\) in single-precision floating-point format, where \\( \pi/4 \approx 0.785398164 \\).
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   \\( | \frac{\tan(x)}{x} - t(x) | < 2^{-25.5} \\), where \\( 2^{-25.5} \approx \[ -2.0 \times 10^{-8}, 2.0 \times 10^{-8} \] \\).
*
* @param {number} x - input value (in radians, assumed to be bounded by ~Ï€/4 in magnitude)
* @param {integer} iy - indicates whether tan (if iy = 1) or -1/tan (if iy = -1) is returned
* @returns {number} tangent
*
* @example
* var out = kernelTanf( 3.141592653589793/4.0, 1 );
* // returns ~1.0
*
* @example
* var out = kernelTanf( 3.141592653589793/4.0, -1 );
* // returns ~-1.0
*
* @example
* var out = kernelTanf( 3.141592653589793/6.0, 1 );
* // returns ~0.577
*
* @example
* var out = kernelTanf( 0.664, 1 );
* // returns ~0.783
*
* @example
* var out = kernelTanf( NaN, 1 );
* // returns NaN

	* Split up the polynomial into small independent terms to give opportunities for parallel evaluation. The chosen splitting is a micro-optimization for specific hardware, as originally documented in FreeBSD's fdlibm. The splitting costs 2 multiplications relative to Horner's method on sequential machines.
	*
	* We add the small terms from lowest degree up for efficiency on non-sequential machines (the lowest degree terms tend to be ready earlier). Apart from this, we don't care about order of operations, and don't need to care since we have precision to spare. However, the chosen splitting is good for accuracy, too, and would give results as accurate as Horner's method if the small terms were added from highest degree down.

{{alias}}( f )
    Evaluates a correction term for single-precision base-2 and base-10
    logarithms when `1 + f` is in `[√2/2, √2]`.

    This function provides a common means for computing logarithms in base e.
    Argument reduction and adding the final term of the polynomial must be done
    by the caller for increased accuracy when different bases are used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f: number
        Input value.

    Returns
    -------
    out: number
        Function value.

    Examples
    --------
    > var y = {{alias}}( 1.0 )
    ~0.1931
    > y = {{alias}}( 1.4142135381698608 )
    ~0.4672
    > y = {{alias}}( NaN )
    NaN
